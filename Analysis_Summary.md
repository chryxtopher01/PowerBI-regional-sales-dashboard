## Executive Summary: Regional Sales Performance at a Glance

This dashboard tells the story of our growth, resilience, and areas for improvement — with 2020 standing out as a defining year.

### Customer Loyalty
Top clients like *Excellent Riding Supplies*, *Corner Bicycle Supply*, and *Totes & Baskets Company* have been pivotal to our success. Their continued trust highlights the power of strong partnerships.

### At a Glance:
- **Total Revenue:** $47M  
- **Total Profit:** $20M  
- **Units Sold:** 195,000+

### Regional Snapshot
North America leads with $16.8M in profit — far ahead of Europe and the Pacific. There's clear potential to apply what's working there to other regions.

### Product Performance
Bikes (especially road and mountain) dominate our sales, while accessories and apparel trail behind — pointing to untapped growth areas.

### 2020’s Profit Dip: Why It Happened
The pandemic hit hard:
- **Supply chain delays** raised costs and cut availability  
- **Consumer belt-tightening** hurt demand  
- **Operational shifts** to remote work and safety protocols added strain  

These disruptions caused the year's sharp decline — a reminder of the need for adaptability.

### Key Concern: Product Concentration
Over 80% of our profit comes from bike sales. We must diversify to reduce risk and future-proof our business.

### What’s Next?
- Deepen customer relationships  
- Apply North American strategies to underperforming regions  
- Promote accessories & apparel  
- Build a more resilient supply chain  
- Stay ahead of shifting customer needs
